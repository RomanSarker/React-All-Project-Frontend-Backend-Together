    <h3>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const:</h3>
    <div>
        <p>var is a function scoped wheres let and const is block scoped, In modern Js we have to use let and const for
            better scoping</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined:</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            null is used to explicitly represent the absence of a value or to clean up references.
            undefined is often unintentional and represents the absence of a defined value or variable.
            null is typically used when you want to convey the deliberate absence of a value, while undefined usually
            indicates an unintentional absence or uninitialized variable.
            Both are falsy values, but they serve slightly different purposes in JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>What do you mean by REST API?:</h3>
    <div>
        <p>REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and principles
            for creating web services that use standard HTTP methods and follow a client-server architecture. It
            emphasizes statelessness, resources, and a uniform interface for easy and scalable communication between
            clients and servers.</p>
